### Library Management System

This project is a console-based application developed in Java, designed to manage the operations of a library. The application demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MySQL database and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver.

#### Key Features:
- **Add Books**: Allows users to add new books to the library database.
- **Update Books**: Enables users to update the details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Provides functionality to remove books from the library database.
- **View Books**: Displays all the books available in the library.
- **Issue Books**: Tracks which books are issued to which members.
- **Return Books**: Manages the return process of the issued books.
- **User Register**: Users can easily create account.
  
#### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The core programming language used to develop the application.
- **MySQL**: The relational database used to store and manage library data.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity, used to connect and interact with the MySQL database.

This project serves as a practical implementation to understand how to perform database operations in Java using JDBC, providing a solid foundation for handling database interactions in Java applications.
